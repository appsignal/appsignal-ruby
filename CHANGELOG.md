# AppSignal for Ruby gem Changelog

## 3.6.2

_Published on 2024-03-08._

### Fixed

- [c3921865](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/c392186573a72fd9afe22299fabcd14dcfe96139) patch - Revert Rack middleware changes (see [changelog](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#360)) to fix issues relating to Unicorn broken pipe errors and multiple requests merging into a single sample.

## 3.6.1

_Published on 2024-03-05._

### Added

- [8974d201](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/8974d20144407fce7a274ebaeb771ef76705d901) patch - Add `activejob_report_errors` config option. When set to `"none"`, ActiveJob jobs will no longer report errors. This can be used in combination with [custom exception reporting](https://docs.appsignal.com/ruby/instrumentation/exception-handling.html). By default, the config option has the value `"all"`, which reports all errors.

## 3.6.0

_Published on 2024-02-26._

### Added

- [9984156f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/9984156faea0a76cb0fe81594e1ddf40d55dabbe) minor - Add instrumentation for all Rack responses, including streaming responses. New `response_body_each.rack`, `response_body_call.rack` and `response_body_to_ary.rack` events will be shown in the event timeline. This will show how long it takes to complete responses, depending on the response implementation.
  
  This Sinatra route with a streaming response will be better instrumented, for example:
  
  ```ruby
  get "/stream" do
    stream do |out|
      sleep 1
      out << "1"
      sleep 1
      out << "2"
      sleep 1
      out << "3"
    end
  end
  ```
- [e7706038](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/e7706038d8b2f52ea90441cfa62d5ee867d893a2) patch - Add histogram support to the OpenTelemetry HTTP server. This allows OpenTelemetry-based instrumentations to report histogram data to AppSignal as distribution metrics.

### Changed

- [11220302](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/112203023a58e53e607a9fd7d545044fa7d896d5) minor - **Breaking change**: Normalize CPU metrics for cgroups v1 systems. When we can detect how many CPUs are configured in the container's limits, we will normalize the CPU percentages to a maximum of 100%. This is a breaking change. Triggers for CPU percentages that are configured for a CPU percentage higher than 100% will no longer trigger after this update. Please configure triggers to a percentage with a maximum of 100% CPU percentage.
- [11220302](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/112203023a58e53e607a9fd7d545044fa7d896d5) patch - Support fractional CPUs for cgroups v2 metrics. Previously a CPU count of 0.5 would be interpreted as 1 CPU. Now it will be correctly seen as half a CPU and calculate CPU percentages accordingly.
- [14aefc35](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/14aefc3594b3f55a4c2ab14ba1259a4f10499467) patch - Update bundled trusted root certificates.

### Fixed

- [f2abbd6a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/f2abbd6aeb2230d79139cbdf82af98557bbe5b54) patch - Fix (sub)traces not being reported in their entirety when the OpenTelemetry exporter sends one trace in multiple export requests. This would be an issue for long running traces, that are exported in several requests.

## 3.5.6

### Changed

- [c76a3293](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/c76a329389c7ce55f1a8307d67fca6c0824c7b6f) patch - Default headers don't contain `REQUEST_URI` anymore as query params are not filtered. Now `REQUEST_PATH` is sent instead to avoid any PII filtering.

## 3.5.5

_Published on 2024-02-01._

### Added

- [d44f7092](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/d44f7092a6a915ebe2825db7b0fe4e8e6eccd873) patch - Add support for the `redis-client` gem, which is used by the redis gem since version 5.

### Changed

- [6b9b814d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/6b9b814d958ca0a13f6da312746c11481bb46cfb) patch - Make the debug log message for OpenTelemetry spans from libraries we don't automatically recognize more clear. Mention the span id and the instrumentation library.
- [6b9b814d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/6b9b814d958ca0a13f6da312746c11481bb46cfb) patch - Fix an issue where queries containing a MySQL leading type indicator would only be partially sanitised.

### Fixed

- [e0f7b0e5](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/e0f7b0e52eb5ed886d0f72941bd1c3c8fe15c9c0) patch - Add more testing to JRuby extension installation to better report the installation result and any possible failures.

## 3.5.4

### Changed

- [1a863490](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/1a863490046318b8cee5fff2ac341fb73065f252) patch - Fix disk usage returning a Vec with no entries on Alpine Linux when the `df --local` command fails.

### Deprecated

- [bb98744b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/bb98744b1b6d34db71b5f46279b1a9b26039bd0f) patch - Deprecate the `Appsignal.set_host_gauge` and `Appsignal.set_process_gauge` helper methods in the Ruby gem. These methods would already log deprecation warnings in the `appsignal.log` file, but now also as a Ruby warning. These methods will be removed in the next major version. These methods already did not report any metrics, and still do not.

### Removed

- [1a863490](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/1a863490046318b8cee5fff2ac341fb73065f252) patch - Remove the `appsignal_set_host_gauge` and `appsignal_set_process_gauge` extension functions. These functions were already deprecated and did not report any metrics.

### Fixed

- [0637b71d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/0637b71dedde155a2494c56f69bf3217e87e851d) patch - Fix the Makefile log path inclusion in the diagnose report. The diagnose tool didn't look in the correct gem extension directory for this log file.
- [fe71d78b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/fe71d78b2c897203bac5e6225bc1e21c6ba2c168) patch - Fix reporting of the Ruby syntax version and JRuby version in install report better.

## 3.5.3

### Changed

- [50708677](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/50708677d3c1b3e630035f5b90458ecefa98e41c) patch - Log a warning when no mountpoints are found to report the disk usage metrics. This scenario shouldn't happen (it should log an error, message about skipping a mountpoint or log the disk usage). Log a warning to detect if this issue really occurs.

## 3.5.2

### Fixed

- [a5963f65](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/a5963f65cd06cdc0f6482be34917c365affc87dd) patch - Fix Ruby Logger 1.6.0 compatibility

## 3.5.1

### Fixed

- [2e93182b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/2e93182b6ae83b16fe9885558cd8f0bfce6a9a5f) patch - Fix an error in the diagnose report when reading a file's contents results in an "Invalid seek" error. This could happen when the log path is configured to `/dev/stdout`, which is not supported.
- [ae0b779b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/ae0b779b3ec00cc46291bc0373d748d720231e74) patch - Fix logger compatibility with Ruby 3.3

## 3.5.0

### Added

- [cee1676f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/cee1676fc5539e380c58e8a824b5c59c3c927119) minor - Nested errors are now supported. The error causes are stored as sample data on the transaction so they can be displayed in the UI.

## 3.4.16

### Changed

- [2149c064](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/2149c064be917d2784c4e5571fdfbd0c2ade59ca) patch - Filter more disk mountpoints for disk usage and disk IO stats. This helps reduce noise in the host metrics by focussing on more important mountpoints.
  
  The following mountpoint are ignored. Any mountpoint containing:
  
  - `/etc/hostname`
  - `/etc/hosts`
  - `/etc/resolv.conf`
  - `/snap/`
  - `/proc/`

### Fixed

- [2149c064](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/2149c064be917d2784c4e5571fdfbd0c2ade59ca) patch - - Support disk usage reporting (using `df`) on Alpine Linux. This host metric would report an error on Alpine Linux.
  - When a disk mountpoint has no inodes usage percentage, skip the mountpoint, and report the inodes information successfully for the inodes that do have an inodes usage percentage.

## 3.4.15

### Changed

- [3fe0fa7a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/3fe0fa7a9cfbee0ca9f3e054155b236bd87c22fb) patch - Bump agent to eec7f7b
  
  Updated the probes dependency to 0.5.2. CPU usage is now normalized to the number of CPUs available to the container. This means that a container with 2 CPUs will have its CPU usage reported as 50% when using 1 CPU instead of 100%. This is a breaking change for anyone using the cpu probe.
  
  If you have CPU triggers set up based on the old behaviour, you might need to update those to these new normalized values to get the same behaviour. Note that this is needed only if the AppSignal integration package you're using includes this change.

## 3.4.14

### Changed

- [bd15ec20](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/bd15ec204474efdc504973609b70074148032618) patch - Bump agent to e8207c1.
  
  - Add `memory_in_percentages` and `swap_in_percentages` host metrics that represents metrics in percentages.
  - Ignore `/snap/` disk mountpoints.
  - Fix issue with the open span count in logs being logged as a negative number.
  - Fix agent's TCP server getting stuck when two requests are made within the same fraction of a second.
- [09b45c80](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/09b45c808c2d4b215bd38211860e8e89225886e6) patch - Bump agent to b604345.
  
  - Add an exponential backoff to the retry sleep time to bind to the StatsD, NGINX and OpenTelemetry exporter ports. This gives the agent a longer time to connect to the ports if they become available within a 4 minute window.
  - Changes to the agent logger:
    - Logs from the agent and extension now use a more consistent format in logs for spans and transactions.
    - Logs that are for more internal use are moved to the trace log level and logs that are useful for debugging most support issues are moved to the debug log level. It should not be necessary to use log level 'trace' as often anymore. The 'debug' log level should be enough.
  - Add `running_in_container` to agent diagnose report, to be used primarily by the Python package as a way to detect if an app's host is a container or not.
- [1945d613](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/1945d61326266e225f13c6b828c51faf13c3745b) patch - Bump agent to 1dd2a18.
  
  - When adding an SQL body attribute via the extension, instead of truncating the body first and sanitising it later, sanitise it first and truncate it later. This prevents an issue where queries containing very big values result in truncated sanitisations.

### Fixed

- [c8698dca](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/c8698dca465d84fdac33d88debc6fbb004458bf1) patch - Fix a deprecation warning for Sidekiq 7.1.6+ when an error is reported to AppSignal. (Thanks @bdewater-thatch!)
- [1c606c6a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/1c606c6a095ac9316cdb6fc26b98c72b9c23b583) patch - Fix an internal error when some Redis info keys we're expecting are missing. This will fix the Sidekiq dashboard showing much less data than we can report when Redis is configured to not report all the data points we expect. You'll still miss out of metrics like used memory, but miss less data than before.

## 3.4.13

### Added

- [29970d93](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/29970d93a63aa174fbc4a41b29eff996ef0ede5e) patch - Events from `dry-monitor` are now supported. There's also native support for `rom-sql` instrumentation events if they're configured.
- [27656744](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/27656744d5d5657d120b4fcd97857c17421d8dfd) patch - Support Rails 7.1 ActiveSupport Notifications handler.

### Changed

- [6932bb3f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/6932bb3f7eae75beeb86e29ddc16dc16f9da4428) patch - Add configuration load modifiers to diagnose report. Track if the `APPSIGNAL_INACTIVE_ON_CONFIG_FILE_ERROR` environment variable was set.

## 3.4.12

### Added

- [441de353](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/441de3537e7a8f36dd2460149c171aaa80929e53) patch - Add an option to not start AppSignal on config file errors. When the `config/appsignal.yml` file raises an error (due to ERB syntax issues or ERB errors), it will currently ignore the config file and try to make a configuration work from the other config sources (default, auto detection and system environment variables). This can cause unexpected behavior, because the config from the config file is not part of the loaded config.
  
  In future versions of the Ruby gem, AppSignal will not start when the config file contains an error. To opt-in to this new behavior, set the `APPSIGNAL_INACTIVE_ON_CONFIG_FILE_ERROR` system environment variable to either `1` or `true`.

### Changed

- [a42da92b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/a42da92b1ff16c48eb40dc081d3b4fbd6480c7c0) patch - Log an error when sample data is of an invalid type. Accepted types are Array and Hash. If any other types are given, it will log an error to the `appsignal.log` file.

### Fixed

- [8e636323](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/8e6363232dc7fabe5f1aeae5758802e4c8d6cbfa) patch - Bump agent to 6133900.
  
  - Fix `disk_inode_usage` metric name format to not be interpreted as a JSON object.

## 3.4.11

### Added

- [4722292d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/4722292d022fb7ff7f3403b964b24e82112e93bd) patch - Re-add support for Ruby 2.7.
- [d782f9a6](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/d782f9a6db0bd679f01c543900b39fc15124a25f) patch - Add the `host_role` config option. This config option can be set per host to generate some metrics automatically per host and possibly do things like grouping in the future.

### Changed

- [f61f4f68](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/f61f4f68699f022d3d9dbb0fa5dc98881923a001) patch - Bump agent to version d789895.
  
  - Increase short data truncation from 2000 to 10000 characters.

## 3.4.10

### Changed

- [61e093b8](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/61e093b8b89efd9914fe5252b6200a288348d394) patch - Bump agent to 6bec691.
  
  - Upgrade `sql_lexer` to v0.9.5. It adds sanitization support for the `THEN` and `ELSE` logical operators.

## 3.4.9

### Added

- [d048c778](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/d048c778e2718110609ba03f4d755953828bf4c5) patch - Allow passing custom data using the `appsignal` context via the Rails error reporter:
  
  ```ruby
  custom_data = { :hash => { :one => 1, :two => 2 }, :array => [1, 2] }
  Rails.error.handle(:context => { :appsignal => { :custom_data => custom_data } }) do
    raise "Test"
  end
  ```

## 3.4.8

### Added

- [5ddde58b](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/5ddde58bb492984626d2dbddb292cecdfc225576) patch - Allow configuration of the agent's TCP and UDP servers using the `bind_address` config option. This is by default set to `127.0.0.1`, which only makes it accessible from the same host. If you want it to be accessible from other machines, use `0.0.0.0` or a specific IP address.
- [74583d26](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/74583d26147e3ec386cdefbd4653abbe805ded96) patch - Report total CPU usage host metric for VMs. This change adds another `state` tag value on the `cpu` metric called `total_usage`, which reports the VM's total CPU usage in percentages.

## 3.4.7

### Added

- [46735abb](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/46735abb0d0c43df2c923b36f80549b8322ae4f6) patch - Use `RENDER_GIT_COMMIT` environment variable as revision if no revision is specified.

### Changed

- [86856aae](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/86856aae7c16dc13854229d43c7369ec69ced18e) patch - Bump agent to 32590eb.
  
  - Only ignore disk metrics that start with "loop", not all mounted disks that end with a number to report metrics for more disks.

## 3.4.6

### Changed

- [85c155a0](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/85c155a0a4b2b618c04db52c34ee7f0adba8f3c5) patch - When sanitizing an array or hash, replace recursively nested values with a placeholder string. This fixes a SystemStackError issue when sanitising arrays and hashes.

## 3.4.5

### Added

- [e5e79d9a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/e5e79d9aa17006a6995e9ea18fabdc14a2356c82) patch - Add `filter_metadata` config option to filter metadata set on Transactions set by default. Metadata like `path`, (request)  `method`, `request_id`, `hostname`, etc. This can be useful if there's PII or other sensitive data in any of the app's metadata.

### Fixed

- [5a4797c8](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/5a4797c8560c2d1e60b4f1a750136c906505746c) patch - Fix Sinatra request custom request parameters method. If the Sinatra option `params_method` is set, a different method than `params` will be called on the request object to fetch the request parameters. This can be used to add custom filtering to parameters recorded by AppSignal.
- [9cdee8aa](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/9cdee8aae3cb7b969583493440469ac0dfea764f) patch - Log error when the argument type of the breadcrumb metadata is invalid. This metadata argument should be a Hash, and other values are not supported. More information can be found in the [Ruby gem breadcrumb documentation](https://docs.appsignal.com/ruby/instrumentation/breadcrumbs.html).
  
  ```ruby
  Appsignal.add_breadcrumb(
    "breadcrumb category",
    "breadcrumb action",
    "some message",
    { :metadata_key => "some value" } # This needs to be a Hash object
  )
  ```

## 3.4.4

### Fixed

- [17500724](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/175007245a5506cf06e5447acad431014b461fff) patch - Fixed a bug that prevented log messages from getting to AppSignal when using the convenience methods as in:
  
  ```ruby
  Rails.logger.warn("Warning message")
  ```

## 3.4.3

### Added

- [8e54a894](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/8e54a8948b815a701277a5da7baf303656548d62) patch - Allow configuration of the agent's StatsD server port through the `statsd_port` option.

### Changed

- [b9a8effe](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/b9a8effeb43644981fc32d6a69757aa4e816a0b0) patch - Update bundled trusted root certificates.
- [d03735c7](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/d03735c7b047d4e27e46dad0d61800ea20a3482f) patch - Bump agent to fd8ee9e.
  
  - Rely on APPSIGNAL_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER config option value before other environment factors to determine if the app is running in a container.
  - Fix container detection for hosts running Docker itself.
  - Add APPSIGNAL_STATSD_PORT config option.

## 3.4.2

### Changed

- [645d749f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/645d749f67c2ead37e44b435a0525e7334d660a2) patch - Update agent to version 6f29190.
  
  - Log revision config in boot debug log.
  - Update internal agent CLI start command.
  - Rename internal `_APPSIGNAL_ENVIRONMENT` variable to `_APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV` to be consistent with the public version.

### Fixed

- [4cd1601e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/4cd1601ecb9ed417c14eaea964a8efa35bbb9f76) patch - Do not run minutely probes on Rails console

## 3.4.1

### Added

- [77ce4e39](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/77ce4e3997fc7525d71f705cb332c05765568dc6) patch - Add Rails [error reporter](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/error_reporting.html) support. Errors reported using `Rails.error.handle` are tracked as separate errors in AppSignal. We rely on our other Rails instrumentation to report the errors reported with `Rails.error.record`.
  
  The error is reported under the same controller/job name, on a best effort basis. It may not be 100% accurate. If `Rails.error.handle` is called within a Rails controller or Active Job job, it will copy the AppSignal transaction namespace, action name and tags from the current transaction to the transaction for the `Rails.error.handle` reported error. If you call `Appsignal.set_namespace`, `Appsignal.set_action` or `Appsignal.tag_request` after `Rails.error.handle`, those changes will not be reflected up in the already reported error.
  
  It is also possible to customize the AppSignal namespace and action name for the reported error using the `appsignal` context:
  
  ```ruby
  Rails.error.handle(:context => { :appsignal => { :namespace => "context", :action => "ContextAction" } }) do
    raise "Test"
  end
  ```
  
  All other key-values are reported as tags:
  
  ```ruby
  Rails.error.handle(:context => { :tag_key => "tag value" }) do
    raise "Test"
  end
  ```
  
  Integration with the Rails error reporter is enabled by default. Disable this feature by setting the `enable_rails_error_reporter` config option to `false`.
- [b4f58afd](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/b4f58afdeb80cd1eb336ec5bd7b5daf46a4ef0a8) patch - Support Sidekiq in Rails error reporter. Track errors reported using `Rails.error.handle` in Sidekiq jobs, in the correct action. Previously it would report no action name for the incident, now it will use the worker name by default.

### Changed

- [e0332791](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/e03327913fdc19db68fc953308eb1e4f2441ba05) patch - Set the AppSignal transaction namespace, action name and some tags, before Active Job jobs are performed. This allows us to check what the namespace, action name and some tags are during the instrumentation itself.
- [4a40699a](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/4a40699a1655bc10b3fa6eb90135374a6b31b195) patch - The AppSignal gem requires Ruby 3 or higher to run. Remove unnecessary Ruby version checks that query Ruby 2.7 or lower.

In Ruby 3.2 the `class_serial` and `global_constant_state` metrics are no longer reported for the "Ruby (VM) metrics" magic dashboard, because Ruby 3.2 removed these metrics. Instead we will now report the new `constant_cache_invalidations` and `constant_cache_misses` metrics reported by Ruby 3.2.
- [6804e898](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/6804e89817234c88105d2376687b5574bfc8e8c9) patch - Use log formatter if set in logger

The MRI probe's `gc_time` will not report any value when the `GC::Profiler.enabled?` returns `false`.

### Changed

- [af7e666c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/af7e666cf173ec1f42e9cf3fce2ab6c8e658440c) patch - Listen if the Ruby Garbage Collection profiler is enabled and collect how long the GC is running for the Ruby VM magic dashboard. An app will need to call `GC::Profiler.enable` to enable the GC profiler. Do not enable this in production environments, or at least not for long, because this can negatively impact performance of apps.

### Fixed

- [b3a163be](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/b3a163be154796e1f358c5061eaee99845c960ee) patch - Fix the MRI probe using the Garbage Collection profiler instead of the NilProfiler when garbage collection instrumentation is not enabled for MRI probe. This caused unnecessary overhead.

- [dc50d889](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/dc50d8892699bf17b2399865ead8b27ce45b60ed) patch - Rename the (so far privately reported) `gc_total_time` metric to `gc_time`. It no longer reports the total time of Garbage Collection measured, but only the time between two (minutely) measurements.

### Fixed

### Changed

- [1b95bb4c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/1b95bb4c8df08128cfa2db0d918ffcb909e5ee4c) patch - Report Garbage Collection total time metric as the delta between measurements. This reports a more user friendly metric that doesn't always goes up until the app restarts or gets a new deploy. This metric is reported 0 by default without `GC::Profiler.enable` having been called.

### Fixed

- [31fd19c6](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/31fd19c6019db2c68b359f1fc4ed3d5e4843e349) patch - Add hostname tag for Ruby VM metrics. This allows us to graph every host separately and multiple hosts won't overwrite each other metrics.

## 3.1.0

### Added

- [d10c3f32](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/d10c3f32facbf399d7afe1d2ddbb5764fb57b008) minor - Add tracking of thread counts, garbage collection runs, heap slots and other garbage collection stats to the default MRI probe.

When a value like `[{ "foo" => "bar" }]` was sanitized it would be stored as `{ "foo" => "?" }`, omitting the parent value's Array square brackets. Now values will appear with the same structure as they were originally sanitized. This only applies to certain integrations like MongoDB, moped and ElasticSearch.
- [096d3cdf](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/096d3cdfd8f452f13b2dbf7de6b763c8a96973b3) patch - Fix the ActiveJob `default_queue_name` config option issue being reset to "default".

## 3.0.22

### Changed

- [9762e79d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/9762e79d4545e50c8f3540deff825b10d77e59a5) patch - Bump agent to v-bbc830a

  Only the actual values are filtered with a `?` character. Less MongoDB queries are now marked
  as N+1 queries when they weren't the exact same query. This increases the number of unique events
  AppSignal tracks for MongoDB queries.

## 3.0.20

### Added

- [35bd83b8](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/35bd83b84fd30f0188d9f134cfd249360b6e281d) patch - Add `send_session_data` option to configure if session data is automatically included transactions.

If it is configured it will print a warning on AppSignal load, but will also retain its functionality until the config option is fully removed in the next major release.
- [e51a8fb6](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby/commit/e51a8fb653fccc5a6b72ac7af9c9417e6827e2e9) patch - Warn about the deprecated `working_dir_path` option from all config sources. It previously only printed a warning when it was configured in the `config/appsignal.yml` file, but now also prints the warning if it's set via the Config class initialize options and environment variables. Please use the `working_directory_path` option instead.
