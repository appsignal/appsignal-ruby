## Description

The AppSignal gem collects exceptions and performance data from your Ruby
applications and sends it to [AppSignal][appsignal] for analysis. Get alerted
when an error occurs or an endpoint is responding very slowly.

AppSignal aims to provide a one stop solution to all your monitoring needs.
Track metrics from your servers with our [Host metrics][host-metrics] and graph
everything else with our [Custom metrics][custom-metrics] feature.

## Usage

First make sure you've installed AppSignal in your application by following the
steps in [Installation](#installation).

AppSignal will automatically monitor requests, report any exceptions that are
thrown and any performance issues that might have occurred.

You can also add extra information to requests by adding custom instrumentation
and by adding tags.

### Track any error

Catch any error and report it to AppSignal, even if it doesn't crash a
request.

```ruby
begin
  config = File.read("config.yml")
rescue => e
  Appsignal.set_error(e)
  # Load alternative config
  config = { :name => ENV["NAME"] }
end
```

Read more about [Exception handling][exception-handling] in our documentation.

### Tagging

Need more information with errors and performance issues? Add tags to your
requests to identify common factors for problems.

```ruby
Appsignal.tag_request(
  user: current_user.id,
  locale: I18n.locale
)
```

Read more about [Tagging][tagging] in our documentation.

### Custom instrumentation

If you need more fine-grained instrumentation you can add custom
instrumentation anywhere in your code.

```ruby
# Simple instrumentation
Appsignal.instrument("array_to_hash.expensive_logic", "Complex calculations") do
  array = [["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]
  Hash[array]
end

# Add the query that you're monitoring
sql = "SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1"
Appsignal.instrument("fetch.custom_database", "Fetch latest post", sql) do
  # ...
end

# Nested instrumentation calls are also supported!
Appsignal.instrument("fetch.custom_database", "Fetch current user") do
  # ...

  Appsignal.instrument("write.custom_database", "Write user update") do
    # ...
  end
end
```

Read more about [custom instrumentation][custom-instrumentation] in our
documentation.

## Installation

First, [sign up][appsignal-sign-up] for an AppSignal account and add the
`appsignal` gem to your `Gemfile`. Then, run `bundle install`.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "appsignal"
```

Afterward, you can use the `appsignal install` command to install AppSignal
into your application by using the "Push API key". This will guide you through
our installation wizard.

```sh
appsignal install [push api key]
```

Depending on what framework or gems you use some manual integration is
required. Follow the steps in the wizard or consult our [integrations] page for
help.

If you're stuck feel free to [contact us][contact]!

## Supported frameworks and gems

AppSignal automatically supports a collection of Ruby frameworks and gems,
including but not limited to:

- Ruby on Rails
- Rack
- Sinatra
- Padrino
- Grape
- Webmachine
- Capistrano
- Sidekiq
- Delayed Job
- Resque
- Rake

AppSignal instrumentation doesn't depend on automatic integrations. It's easy
to set up [custom instrumentation][custom-instrumentation] to add keep track of
anything.

For more detailed information and examples please visit our
[integrations] page.

### Front-end monitoring (Beta)

We have a [Front-end monitoring program][front-end-monitoring] running in Beta
currently. Be sure to check it out!

## Supported systems

Currently the AppSignal agent works on most Unix-like operating systems, such
as most Linux distributions, FreeBSD, macOS, excluding Microsoft Windows.

For more detailed information please visit our [Supported
systems][supported-systems] page.

## Releases

Following the process below to release a new version of the Ruby gem.

1. Make sure [mono](https://github.com/appsignal/mono/) is installed by
   following the installation instructions.
1. Run: `mono publish`
   - Mono will automatically bump the version number based on the
     `.changesets/`.
   - Mono will automatically update the `CHANGELOG.md` file based on the
     `.changesets/`.
1. Confirm with your two-factor authentication token for Rubygems.org, _twice_.

## Development

### Installation

Make sure you have Bundler installed and then use the Rake install task to
install all possible dependencies.

```bash
# Install Bundler
gem install bundler
# Bootstrap the project
mono bootstrap
# Install the AppSignal extension and _all_ gems we support.
bundle exec rake install
# Only install the AppSignal extension.
bundle exec rake extension:install
```

#### Git source for Bundler

When specifying a git source for the AppSignal gem in Bundler we do not support
JRuby. This is because our gemspec defaults to the Ruby implementation for
installing the AppSignal C-extension.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "appsignal",
  :git => "https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-ruby.git",
  :branch => "main"
```

When you need to use a git source of the gem in your JRuby install, you'll need
to run the following to install the C-extension on JRuby. Note that this
post-install step is not possible on platforms such as Heroku where the app is
sent through a deploy pipeline and the app is started immediately after.

```bash
bundle install
(cd $(bundle show appsignal)/ext && rake)
```

### Testing

```bash
bundle exec rspec
# Or with one file
bundle exec rspec spec/lib/appsignal_spec.rb
```

Note that some specs depend on certain other gems to run and if they are not
loaded RSpec will not run them. See also [Testing with other
gems](#testing-with-other-gems).

#### Testing with other gems

AppSignal runs in many different configurations. To replicate these
configurations you need to run the spec suite with a specific Gemfile.

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/capistrano2.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/capistrano3.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/dry-monitor.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/grape.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/hanami.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/http5.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/no_dependencies.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/padrino.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/que.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/que_beta.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-3.2.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-4.0.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-4.1.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-4.2.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-5.0.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-5.1.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-5.2.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-6.0.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/resque-1.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/resque-2.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/sequel-435.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/sequel.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/sinatra.gemfile bundle exec rspec
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/webmachine.gemfile bundle exec rspec
```

If you have either [RVM][rvm], [rbenv][rbenv] or [chruby][chruby] installed you
can also use `rake build_matrix:local:generate` to generate a script that runs
specs for all Ruby versions and gem combinations we support.

We run the suite against all of the Gemfiles mentioned above and on
a number of different Ruby versions.

### Versioning

This gem uses [Semantic Versioning][semver].

The `main` branch corresponds to the current stable release of the gem.

The `develop` branch is used for development of features that will end up in
the next minor release.

Open a Pull Request on the `main` branch if you're fixing a bug. For new new
features, open a Pull Request on the `develop` branch.

Every stable and unstable release is tagged in git with a version tag.
