Add a Rails configuration option to start AppSignal after Rails is initialized. By default, AppSignal will start before the Rails initializers are run. It is not possible to configure AppSignal in a Rails initializer using Ruby. To configure AppSignal in a Rails initializer, configure Rails to start AppSignal after it is initialized.

```ruby
# config/application.rb

# ...

module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Add this line
    config.appsignal.start_at = :after_initialize

    # Other config
  end
end
```

Then, in the initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/appsignal.rb

Appsignal.config = Appsignal::Config.new(
  Rails.root,
  Rails.env,
  :ignore_actions => ["My action"]
)
```

Be aware that with `start_at` set to `after_initialize` AppSignal will not track any errors that occur when the initializers are run and the app fails to start.

See [our Rails documentation](https://docs.appsignal.com/ruby/integrations/rails.html) for more information.
