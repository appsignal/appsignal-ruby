        # The logic of how Rack treats a response body differs based on which methods
        # the body responds to. This means that to support the Rack 3.x spec in full
        # we need to return a wrapper which matches the API of the wrapped body as closely
        # as possible. Pick the wrapper from the most specific to the least specific.
        # See https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/main/SPEC.rdoc#the-body-
        #
        # What is important is that our Body wrapper responds to the same methods Rack
        # (or a webserver) would be checking and calling, and passes through that functionality
        # to the original body. This can be done using delegation via i.e. SimpleDelegate
        # but we also need "close" to get called correctly so that the Appsignal transaction
        # gets completed - which will not happen, for example, when #to_ary gets called
        # just on the delegated Rack body.

        # This comment https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49627#issuecomment-1769802573
