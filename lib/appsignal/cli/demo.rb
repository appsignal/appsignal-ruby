    #
    # This command line tool is useful when testing AppSignal on a system and
    # validating the local configuration. It tests if the installation of
    # AppSignal has succeeded and if the AppSignal agent is able to run on the
    # machine's architecture and communicate with the AppSignal servers.
    #
    # The same test is also run during installation with
    # {Appsignal::CLI::Install}.
    #
    # ## Exit codes
    #
    # - Exits with status code `0` if the demo command has finished.
    # - Exits with status code `1` if the demo command failed to finished.
    #
    # @example On the command line in your project
    #   appsignal demo
    #
    # @example With a specific environment
    #   appsignal demo --environment=production
