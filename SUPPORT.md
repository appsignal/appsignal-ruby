# Support

[Contact us][contact] and speak directly with the engineers working on
AppSignal. They will help you get set up, tweak your code and make sure you get
the most out of using AppSignal. You can also find our documentation at
[docs.appsignal.com](https://docs.appsignal.com/).

We do not recommend creating an issue on the Ruby gem's GitHub project if it
concerns your private app data. During the support process we'll need the
AppSignal logs and other resources that contain your app's private data,
something for which the public GitHub issue tracker is not suited.

Please contact us on our website (appsignal.com)[https://appsignal.com/] or via
email at [support@appsignal.com][contact].
